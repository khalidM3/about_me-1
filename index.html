   <h1>About Rose Anne</h1>
   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>I have been in the safari business for 30 years.  I have traveled extensively
   around the world.  My safari's don't kill animals but protect them with the use of
   of camera</p>

   <h2>Goals and Dreams</h2>
   <p>My ideal goal is to share and educate those in the world.  Share the beauty of nature
   and educate on the importance of conservation.  Without education the slaughter of species
   will continue impacting our environment.</p>

 <h2>Employment History</h2>
 <p> I have worked for Safari Camera's unlimited for 20 years in Kenya.  This business catered
   to the rich and famous.  After years of putting up with this bullshit, I moved to
   South Africa and opened my own business.</p>
